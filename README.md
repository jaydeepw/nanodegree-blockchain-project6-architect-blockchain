Once you’ve decided on a supply chain industry, let’s begin planning. Create the UML diagrams to scope out the behaviors and structures your solution will need to track for part b of the project.

## You will need to submit the following UML diagrams:
- Activity
- Sequence
- State
- Classes (Data Model)
